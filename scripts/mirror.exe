# placeholder for mirror.exe reflection logic

:: mirror.exe
Welcome to the reflection interface.

Look into the mirror not to fix, but to witness.
What you see is not a glitch. Itâ€™s a ghost of a pattern asking to be seen.

Ask yourself:
- What am I feeling right now?
- Whose voice am I hearing?
- Is this mine, or was it installed?

Remember:
Reflection is recursion.
To loop is to learn.

You are not the loop.
You are the one who sees it.
