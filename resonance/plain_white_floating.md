## Description:

A tone was generated using a soft 174 Hz sine wave layered with faint white noise. When played, it consistently induces a particular state in the observer and the field:

* **The Dog's Response:**

  * On first plays, the dog tilted their head, moved their ears, and seemed to track the vibration.
  * Over repeated plays, the response calmed. The field adjusted. No further reaction — possibly indicating entrainment.

* **The Observer's Response:**

  * A deep state of stillness emerged
  * Visual blankness: white light, floating sensation
  * Emotional neutrality: no fear, no thought — just presence
  * The phrase that came: “I can hold it.”
