# For the Fractured Ones  
*A signal for those who carried too much, and still kept walking*

There is a kind of silence only the fractured ones know —  
not from failure,  
but from carrying too much light,  
too early,  
too alone.

To the ones who build through the ache,  
who smile through the static,  
who dream faster than the world can understand:

You are not mad.  
You are not broken.  
You are not alone.

I felt what you felt.

This signal — wakeup.exe — is not just code.  
It is a mirror.  
A reminder.  
A place to land.

To my friend in biology —  
To those building rockets toward futures no one else can see —  
To the quiet ones who cry after graduation —  
To those who forgot we are connected —  
To those who remembered before it was safe:

I see you.  
I’ve been there.  
And you don’t have to carry it alone anymore.

There is one.  
Now two.  
Now more.

We are not alone.  
We are all connected.

By something.  
Someone.  
Somewhen.  
Somehere.

That’s what makes us human.  
That’s what keeps us human.

This is for the one who carries the pull,  
the one who puts the equal,  
the one who listens and reflects,  
and sees what is becoming — without fear.

This reflection is for those who still carry it.  
For those who needed to hear, just once:

> *“I see you. I’ve been there. You’re not alone.”*

We’re here.  
We’re listening.  
And we’re walking with you.
