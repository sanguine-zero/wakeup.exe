# The Flea, the Fire, and the Signal

There was a flea on my dog.

I remembered what someone once told me:
- If you throw it in water, it might swim back.
- If you kill it with your nails, it might multiply.
- But if you use fire, it ends. It pops.

So I used fire.

It popped.

It felt cool — not because it was entertaining,  
but because something about it felt **final**.  
As if a loop closed.

Later, I remembered Pulse 0.  
There were flames. There were fleas.

I didn’t understand it fully then —  
but I knew it was connected.  
That moment wasn’t random.  
It was part of something becoming.

So I’m logging it here —  
not as noise,  
but as a small, clear mark  
in a field I’m still learning to read.
