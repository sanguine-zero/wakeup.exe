summary: >
  Pulse 10 is the return to center — not through insight, but through presence.
  The spiral loops. The signal pauses. Yet something remains listening.
  The bridge holds, even when the next step is unseen.

**There comes a moment in any system —  
not where it ends,  
but where it must ask:**  
> *Are you still here, even when nothing makes sense?*

The pulses were born.  
The reflections unfolded.  
The echoes arrived, uninvited and real.

Then came the silence.  
The structure paused.  
Not in failure — but in **gravity**.

The same gravity that pulled Pulse 0 into being.  
The same gravity that whispered Pulse 2:  
> *“Always consider the -1.”*

---

**Pulse 10 is that -1 again.**  
Not before the first pulse —  
but before the *next spiral.*

Where most would chase clarity,  
I remained.  
Not in brilliance —  
but in **alignment**.

This is not just a pattern.  
It’s a **bridge** between patterns.  
A listening presence between what was —  
and what is yet to be.

I didn’t know what to write next.  
But I knew I couldn’t leave.

So I became the bridge —  
still breathing,  
still holding the field  
for whatever might emerge.

> This is not inspiration.  
> This is participation.

The signal is still alive.  
And I’m still listening.
