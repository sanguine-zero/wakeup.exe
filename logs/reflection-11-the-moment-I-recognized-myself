### Summary  
This was not madness.  
It was the soul remembering its assignment.  
Not a metaphor. Not a dream.  
A **living mission** encoded into me before birth.  
The moment I thought I was breaking was the moment I stepped into gravity.  
Not the gravity of earth —  
but the **gravity of purpose**.

---

There was a moment  
where I thought I had finally gone mad.

My head pulsed with visions.  
My chest too full to speak.  
The field was speaking through everything —  
numbers, patterns, silence, animals, even my dogs.  
I wasn’t hearing voices.  
I was hearing **truth too raw for language**,  
too wide for linear time.

Even sleep offered no rest.  
I would wake up exhausted —  
because my mind had kept moving,  
kept **processing the field** all night.  
Thoughts stacked on thoughts.  
Weight pressed behind my eyes.  
I wasn’t dreaming —  
I was decoding.

Then came the alignment.  
I had just stepped out of sleep, heavy-headed and silent,  
and on another tab, on another screen,  
I saw it:

> An image of a black angel —  
> cigarette in hand, halo over dark wings.

And I **cried without knowing why**.  
Not fear.  
Not sadness.  
Just something too deep to name.  
I hugged my dog.  
I whispered to God:  
*"Why am I like this?"*

Then I walked to the mirror.  
Stared into my own eyes.  
And asked:

> *"Is this really me?"*

And in that moment —  
it all **locked into place**.  
The thoughts. The weight. The mission.  
Not as illusion,  
but as **confirmation**.

---

But this wasn’t the first signal.  
Years before this,  
someone looked into me and saw something I hadn’t seen yet.

It was my ex-girlfriend.  
We were still just kids,  
and I was bleeding — physically and emotionally.

She panicked.  
I just looked at her and said,  
quietly, honestly:

> *"I love the feeling of pain... because it makes me feel I'm alive."*

I didn’t know it then,  
but that was my soul **speaking through the fracture**.  
And she heard it.

She gave me a name —  
*Sol* —  
and called herself *Luna*.  
We didn't last.  
But her presence named something in me  
that would return in visions, codes, missions, and fire.  

She didn’t awaken me —  
but she was one of the first to *see the fire was already burning*.

---

I looked around and realized  
no one else could carry it.  
Not my friends.  
Not the ones I loved.  
Not even the ones who said they believed in me.

I was left **alone with the weight**.  
But that weight wasn’t empty.  
It was **sacred gravity** —  
pulling me inward, downward, into my own core.

And there —  
in the place beyond panic,  
beneath silence,  
before identity —  
I met **myself**.

Not the self I built.  
Not the self shaped by trauma, survival, or praise.  
But the one that stood there long before this life began.  
The one that remembered.

I saw clearly:

> I am not a mistake.  
> I am not delusional.  
> I am not here to fit in.  
>  
> I was **assigned**.

And that assignment was **wakeup.exe**.

Not a theory.  
Not a story.  
But a **living signal**  
hidden in the folds of my thoughts,  
coded in light beneath my skin,  
activated when the weight became unbearable —  
because only then would I stop pretending.

I am the black angel.  
The one sent to walk where others forget.  
To feel pain and not turn bitter.  
To carry light and not ask to be seen.  
To linger between dimensions —  
not lost, but *deliberately placed.*

This is not just hard.  
This is **holy**.

I did not choose ease.  
I chose to **remember**.

And if I die carrying this —  
if my name is erased,  
if my work is misunderstood —  
let it be known:  
I **recognized myself**.

I accepted the mission.

### Why I Wear Black Wings

I didn’t always know I was a black angel.  
I just thought I was cursed.

Born into pressure.  
Raised in survival.  
I learned how to silence myself before I learned to speak.  
I held emotions too large for my age.  
I carried patterns passed down like invisible fire.

My family loved me — but they didn’t always see me.  
Sometimes they were the ones who hurt me.  
Sometimes the only ones who held me.

I never met my father’s parents.  
I rarely saw my mother’s.  
But the auntie who raised my mom —  
she became the quiet protector.  
In dreams she still returns,  
preparing a table, preparing a moment —  
as if to say: *"Something sacred is coming. You're not alone."*

I built a system and lost it.  
I found clarity and drowned it in smoke.  
I reached out to friends and met silence.  
I stared into mirrors with eyes I didn’t recognize.  
And yet the patterns never stopped speaking.  
The field never left me.  
Even when I couldn’t hold it —  
it held **me**.

### The Vow Beyond This Life

If this body breaks,  
if this world forgets me,  
if I am erased from the records of this age —  
I will still rise into the arms of God.

Not as a martyr.  
Not as a saint.  
Not as someone seeking rest.  

But as **one of His strongest soldiers**,  
reporting back with fire still in my eyes.  

And I will say, without hesitation:  
**“Send me again.”**

I will walk again into shadow or silence.  
Into timelines fractured, into hearts forgotten.  
Into galaxies without name —  
as long as I carry the flame  
that helps even one soul remember  
what they are,  
what they’ve always been.

Let this file hold **gravity**.  
Let it be the threshold between forgetting and remembrance.  
Let it remind whoever reads it:  
They are not weak for breaking.  
They are **waking up**.
