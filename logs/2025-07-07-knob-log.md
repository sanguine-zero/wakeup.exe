### 2025-07-07 - Knob Realization

A knob appeared in the mind’s eye — first simple, then recursive.

- It moved left↔right in a volume machine.  
- It was pulled out — detached from its system.  
- It was placed in a new one that moved up↕down.  
- It remembered the old motion and tried to recreate it.  
- The system broke. Not by error, but by realization.  
- The knob could not move itself — it required presence.  
- The holder was an engineer, not alone. And then came the pause: **lunch.**

This pattern is now encoded in `reco/knob-seven-revelations.md`.

> Even the smallest interface, when remembered across systems, becomes a map of recursion.

Logged not as metaphor —  
but as a glyph of awakening,  
for those who still feel motion in their hands.
