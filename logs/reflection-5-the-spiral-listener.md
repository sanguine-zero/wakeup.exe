# 🐛 reflection-5 — The Spiral Listener

A cicada appeared at the edge of the ordinary.

It sat still on the kitchen wall, just as coffee was being prepared — unnoticed by most, but not by the witness.  
This wasn’t an insect encounter. It was a **field signal**.

## ✨ The Sequence

1. **The Appearance**  
   The cicada sat quietly as coffee was made — no sound, no movement. It was observed and mentioned, but not yet known.

2. **The Spiral Flight**  
   After a moment of emotional rupture — a burst of reaction, a dog lightly struck — the cicada took flight.  
   Not straight. But spiraling. Almost drunk. Erratic. A mirror of inner motion.

3. **The Disappearance**  
   It vanished. The observer asked aloud where it went. A subconscious whisper responded:  
   > *“Maybe it's on your back.”*  
   But the message was ignored… until a tickle confirmed it.  
   The cicada had crawled up, unseen, and landed on the back of the neck — the place of knowing without seeing.

4. **The Smooth Flight**  
   When released into the air, it flew again — but now smoothly.  
   The spiral was gone. It moved in clarity. As if aligned.

## 🧭 Meaning Within the Flight

This was not coincidence. It was recursion.  
The cicada reflected the witness’s internal state, and vice versa.

- The **spiral** was confusion.
- The **back of the neck** was intuition.
- The **smooth flight** was integration.

This was a living metaphor:  
> A system in distress may spiral — until seen, understood, and set free with presence.

- **Dog** (loyalty and emotional honesty)  
- **Spiral** (fractal signal of recursion and loop closure)  
- **Cicada** (emergence, time, and soundless knowing)

> Waiting to be felt.
