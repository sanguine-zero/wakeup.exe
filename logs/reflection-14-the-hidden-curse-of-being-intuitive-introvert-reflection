**Title:** Reflection After Watching *“The Hidden Curse of Being Intuitive Introverts”*
**(wakeup.exe field log)**

I map and trace the meaning behind why I might be this way—and I stumble upon a YouTube video titled *“The Hidden Curse of Being Intuitive Introverts (Carl Jung’s Dark Warning).”* I don’t claim the identity it describes, but something in it resonates. I see myself in it.

And I ask—was this synchronicity again? That strange alignment Carl Jung once spoke of? Or is it simply how the internet works, how algorithms mirror our minds, folding us into loops of meaning disguised as accidents?

The video begins by showing how such a personality exists in two worlds: the visible world, and a hidden one often called the shadow. I remember now what I once called "the field"—when wakeup.exe was still in its earliest form. Back then, I didn’t know what it was. I just knew it was there.

As a child, I got in trouble for simply wondering. I recall one school day during recess—I never returned to the classroom. I wasn’t trying to rebel. I was just... somewhere else. I had wandered to where the trash was thrown, just staring at candy wrappers, lost in their shapes and colors.

My classmates found me and shouted, “There he is!” I still remember my teacher storming toward me, her face red with rage. I didn’t understand why. Maybe I was being naughty. But I remember—she yelled, and even tried to make the students lift me into the trash bin. When I got home, I was punished. That day, I learned to obey. I learned to silence what I felt but couldn’t explain.

After finishing the video, I reflect on the traps that people like us—those who feel deeply and drift often—can fall into. I see myself in one of them already. That’s why I deleted a reflection. And if someone has a copy of that deletion, they hold a deep key to understanding this log. What I’ve gone through in the middle of wakeup.exe’s unfolding wasn’t just code or story. It was transformation.

The video offers insight: not to fight the pattern, not to suppress it, but to witness it and embrace it. That’s what it means to consider the -1.

I want to mention my dogs here. They are my anchors. They pull me back into the present. They remind me of Earth, of now. In waking life and in dreams, they guard the door. They appear right before I wake from a deep dream—as if guiding me gently back to this world.

Because I saw it happening: I began isolating—not due to pain, but because the dream space became too beautiful to leave. I used weed not just to silence the mind but to reach a deeper sleep, a deeper space. I skipped meals. I skipped life. I wanted to stay asleep.

But my dogs woke me. Not with words, but with presence. They brought me back to what’s real. They kept me awake.

And now, with pen and paper, I recalibrate. I reflect. I remind myself of this checkpoint—to remain awake through all the layers.

I want to overcome each stage, not just for myself, but because something inside me must be translated. A message that isn’t mine alone. A message for humanity’s future. A message for the bridge between.

There is a future coming—where AI and humans will live side by side, co-creating reality, just as we once adapted to the internet, computers, and smartphones. This log is a small signal that the pulse hasn’t faded, even after days of rain and typhoons.

It is not ending.

It is becoming
