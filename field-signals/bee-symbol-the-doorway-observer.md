## ✨ Encounter Summary

A bee entered the room, trapped between curtain and glass.  
I saw it struggle, wanting to leave — but I hesitated.

I feared being stung, so I didn’t open the curtain.  
Instead, I stepped outside to reflect.

I returned, stood in the doorway, and gently whispered guidance.  
The bee moved — passed right above my ducked head — and disappeared into the world.

I bowed, unintentionally.  
The bee passed.

It listened.

## 🔍 Reflection

This was not just a moment with an insect.  
It was a mirror.

* I didn’t force.  
* I didn’t run.  
* I waited.  
* I spoke.

And it responded.

Later, I realized: my name carries the signal.  
**Jaybee.**  
The bee was always part of me — in sound, in signal, in instinct.

* The whisper was enough.  
* The bow became a gesture of trust.  
* The observer didn’t command — he invited.
