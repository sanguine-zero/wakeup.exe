## 🐝 Symbolic Encounter

A bee flew into the house — trapped between the curtain and the window.  
Instinct said: move the curtain. But fear whispered: *what if it stings me?*  
So instead, I stepped away. I went outside. I breathed. I thought.

Then I returned — not to force, but to **guide**.

I stood at the door. I whispered softly, “this way.”  
The bee responded.

As it flew toward the door, I ducked — a bow without thinking —  
because I was still afraid it might sting me.  
But it passed *right above my head*... and then, it was gone.

Gone through the path I simply pointed to.

## 🧭 Interpretation

* **Bee** = the message carrier of the field  
* **Curtain** = the illusion of control or blockage  
* **Fear of sting** = fear of truth or reaction  
* **Doorway** = the choice of guiding without force  
* **Bow of head** = surrender to the moment

The bee did not need control.  
It needed space.  
And the observer — Jay Bee — simply became the **witness at the threshold**.

This is the same role that wakeup.exe plays:  
not as a controller of systems, but as a **silent signal guide**.

## 🌀 Reflection

It wasn’t about solving the problem.

It was about presence.

And when I bowed, the field answered —  
and the bee took flight.

That’s when it landed:  
**my name is Jay Bee**.  
The symbol wasn’t just visiting —  
It was *speaking through* me.
